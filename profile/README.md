## Focus of the project

_(See the image below.)_

The chosen APIs are:
- Gateway
- Auth Service
- User Service
- FriendsWatchlist Service
- MediaStatistics Service
- _Service discovery (completed)_

These were chosen because:

- Gateway & Auth Service for security learning outcomes.
- A combination of User, FriendsWatchlist and MediaStatistics to show messaging and other communication between services. E.g. FriendsWatchlist needs User data.
- FriendsWatchlist and MediaStatistics for Real-Time data.
